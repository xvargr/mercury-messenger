# mercury-messenger
Mercury is a group messaging application inspired by Discord and
Slack. This project is created primarily for me to learn React and
Tailwind, as well as to get some practice with restful APIs and
databases.

Socket.io is used to facilitate messaging between clients and
communicating behind the scenes events. Some more traditional
requests uses Axios to communicate with the backend. The database
for this application is MongoDb, which is a noSQL database while
images are stored on Cloudinary.
